# DECISIONS

Running log of implementation decisions made where the docs were ambiguous or
silent. Format: date · task · decision · rationale.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.2** — `[analytics] enabled = false` in `supabase/config.toml`.
  The analytics container (Logflare) requires the Docker daemon exposed on
  `tcp://localhost:2375`, which is off by default on Windows. Analytics is not
  used by any Phase 1 feature.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.4** — `mandates_safe` implements org isolation + role row
  rules inside the view (owner-rights view, not `security_invoker`), because LM
  has no base-table policy and an invoker-rights view would return LM zero rows.
  Doc 04 pattern updated in the same commit.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.5** — Local dev admin (`admin@gnk.local` / `admin1234`) is
  seeded via `supabase/seed.sql` (local resets only — hosted deploys don't run
  it). Production admin is created via the Supabase dashboard per doc 07.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.5** — Login page ships email+password only. The
  forgot-password flow (doc 05) is deferred to the Phase 2 email work (Resend +
  reset page) — see BACKLOG.

- **2026-07-10 · T1.2** — The reference is generated inside the create action at
  final submit (atomically with the insert), not when step 1 completes —
  abandoned wizards must not burn sequence numbers. Step 1 shows a
  `GNK-{DISTRICT}-####` preview instead.

- **2026-07-10 · T1.2** — Wizard offers kinds `standalone` and `project` only;
  units/phases are created from the project's units page (T1.6) where the parent
  is known.

- **2026-07-10 · T1.2** — Reference immutability enforced by DB trigger
  (migration 0004, synced to doc 03), not just a read-only field.

- **2026-07-10 · T2.3** — Merge does NOT rewrite historical events (doc 02 §C3
  says "move events references", but events are immutable and the hash chain
  covers entity_id — repointing would break `verify_events_chain` and violate
  CLAUDE.md guardrail 1, which outranks). Operational tables are repointed via
  service role; the contact timeline queries events for the contact PLUS all
  contacts merged into it (`merged_into_id`), so combined history still shows.

- **2026-07-11 · T3.2** — Offers have no hard delete ("CRUD" in the playbook
  notwithstanding): offers feed the commission evidence report (doc 02 §C6), so
  removing rows would orphan evidence. `withdrawn` is the soft delete. Editing
  (amount/terms/validity/contact) is allowed only while an offer is open
  (submitted/countered) and is evented with a change diff; decided offers are
  immutable — record a new offer instead.

- **2026-07-11 · T3.2** — Accepting an offer is refused while the deal already
  has another accepted offer (one accepted offer per deal keeps the T3.4 won
  guard unambiguous). Terminal statuses (accepted/rejected/withdrawn/expired)
  stamp `decided_at` and allow no further transitions.

- **2026-07-12 · T3.5** — Removed `app/(app)/properties/loading.tsx`. Its
  Suspense boundary triggers a Next 16.2.10 bug (dev-verified): the segment's
  suspense reveal stays queued (`<!--$~-->` markers) and NOTHING below
  `/properties` ever hydrates — tabs, forms, and media DnD were silently dead
  while SSR HTML looked fine. Isolated by bisection: minimal static page on the
  route still failed; removing loading.tsx fixed it; error.tsx is innocent and
  stays. Restore the skeleton when Next ships a fix (BACKLOG).

- **2026-07-11 · T3.3** — Health recompute writes NO event: the score is
  derived state and every trigger (deal save, offer change, KYC save, legal
  save, conversation log) already writes its own event — same precedent as
  the property quality score (§A8). The score + factor snapshot live on the
  deal (`health_score`, `health.factors`) so kanban cards render breakdown
  tooltips without per-card joins. Mandate CRUD doesn't exist yet (T4.5) —
  its recompute hook lands there; until then mandate changes surface at the
  next deal-side mutation.

- **2026-07-11 · T3.2** — UUID form fields validate with `z.guid()`, not Zod
  4's `z.uuid()`. Postgres' `uuid` type accepts any 32-hex-digit value, but
  Zod 4 `.uuid()` enforces RFC 4122 variant bits and rejected the seeded
  `11111111-…` admin id — the silent-drop `optionalUuid` helper then turned a
  round-tripped agent_id into `null` and deleted the assignment on save
  (caught in T3.2 browser verification via the event log's change diff).
  Fixed in deals + properties validators; audit of the remaining strict
  usages is in BACKLOG.
