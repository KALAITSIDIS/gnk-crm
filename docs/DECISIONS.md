# DECISIONS

Running log of implementation decisions made where the docs were ambiguous or
silent. Format: date · task · decision · rationale.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.2** — `[analytics] enabled = false` in `supabase/config.toml`.
  The analytics container (Logflare) requires the Docker daemon exposed on
  `tcp://localhost:2375`, which is off by default on Windows. Analytics is not
  used by any Phase 1 feature.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.4** — `mandates_safe` implements org isolation + role row
  rules inside the view (owner-rights view, not `security_invoker`), because LM
  has no base-table policy and an invoker-rights view would return LM zero rows.
  Doc 04 pattern updated in the same commit.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.5** — Local dev admin (`admin@gnk.local` / `admin1234`) is
  seeded via `supabase/seed.sql` (local resets only — hosted deploys don't run
  it). Production admin is created via the Supabase dashboard per doc 07.

- **2026-07-09 · T0.5** — Login page ships email+password only. The
  forgot-password flow (doc 05) is deferred to the Phase 2 email work (Resend +
  reset page) — see BACKLOG.

- **2026-07-10 · T1.2** — The reference is generated inside the create action at
  final submit (atomically with the insert), not when step 1 completes —
  abandoned wizards must not burn sequence numbers. Step 1 shows a
  `GNK-{DISTRICT}-####` preview instead.

- **2026-07-10 · T1.2** — Wizard offers kinds `standalone` and `project` only;
  units/phases are created from the project's units page (T1.6) where the parent
  is known.

- **2026-07-10 · T1.2** — Reference immutability enforced by DB trigger
  (migration 0004, synced to doc 03), not just a read-only field.

- **2026-07-10 · T2.3** — Merge does NOT rewrite historical events (doc 02 §C3
  says "move events references", but events are immutable and the hash chain
  covers entity_id — repointing would break `verify_events_chain` and violate
  CLAUDE.md guardrail 1, which outranks). Operational tables are repointed via
  service role; the contact timeline queries events for the contact PLUS all
  contacts merged into it (`merged_into_id`), so combined history still shows.

- **2026-07-11 · T3.2** — Offers have no hard delete ("CRUD" in the playbook
  notwithstanding): offers feed the commission evidence report (doc 02 §C6), so
  removing rows would orphan evidence. `withdrawn` is the soft delete. Editing
  (amount/terms/validity/contact) is allowed only while an offer is open
  (submitted/countered) and is evented with a change diff; decided offers are
  immutable — record a new offer instead.

- **2026-07-11 · T3.2** — Accepting an offer is refused while the deal already
  has another accepted offer (one accepted offer per deal keeps the T3.4 won
  guard unambiguous). Terminal statuses (accepted/rejected/withdrawn/expired)
  stamp `decided_at` and allow no further transitions.

- **2026-07-14 · T5.5** — Tasks. The feedback nudge stays a live QUERY
  rendered as a virtual section on /tasks (and the agent dashboard), NOT
  materialized task rows — task rows for it would need syncing when feedback
  arrives and could drift; the mandate-renewal auto-tasks ARE rows (created
  by expire_mandates, T4.5) and show an AUTO chip via `mandate_id`. Quick-add
  due dates store as Cyprus end-of-day (23:59 wall clock → UTC) so a task due
  "today" only turns overdue after the day actually ends. Done/reopen write
  `completed`/`reopened` events on entity `task` (acceptance).

- **2026-07-14 · T5.4** — Settings. Invites create the auth user with a
  ONE-TIME password shown once to the admin (no SMTP in Phase 1 — invite
  emails + self-service reset ride the Phase 2-3 email integration; doc 05's
  "reset 2FA" is skipped for the same reason, BACKLOG). Deactivation sets
  `is_active=false` AND bans the auth user (876000h) so the login itself is
  refused, not just the profile flagged; reactivation lifts both. Stage
  reordering parks the moving stage on sort_order -1 before swapping — the
  unique (org, deal_type, sort_order) index forbids a direct swap. New stages
  insert before the terminal won/lost stages, which shift up to stay last.
  cyprus_config saves shape-check transfer_fees/stamp_duty with the calculator
  parsers before writing (guardrail 5: a typo cannot produce nonsense fees).
  Branding uploads overwrite fixed paths in the public media bucket
  (branding/logo.png, branding/watermark.png — the watermark path the T1.4
  media pipeline already reads); cache-busted by the file's updated_at.

- **2026-07-14 · T5.3** — Dashboards. Guardrail 6 fixes three dashboards;
  listing managers get the AGENT view (their "my …" blocks scope to their own
  id) until the Owner/Developer dashboard ships in a later phase. Aggregations
  run in TS over minimal selects because PostgREST aggregate functions are
  disabled; the equivalent SQL sits in a comment above every query
  (acceptance: numbers reproducible by manual SQL — verified for all seven
  admin blocks). Stage bars filter by deal COUNT, not value, so €0-value
  pipelines still render (display "€X · N"). Charts are plain CSS bars — no
  chart library enters the stack for five bar lists. "Hot buyer idle" = no
  contact-scoped event within 3 days (contacts with zero events count as
  idle). The T4.3 feedback nudge moved to the agent dashboard per doc 05;
  admin KPI "won this month" carries the T3.4 acceptance forward.

- **2026-07-13 · T5.2** — Evidence report. The footer "report hash" is the
  SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of the ROWS (recomputable by regenerating with
  the same filters), not of the PDF file — the file contains the hash, so it
  cannot contain its own digest; the PDF file's SHA-256 goes into the
  `evidence_report_generated` event payload instead. Assembly runs on the
  caller's RLS client (what the agent can't see stays out of the report); the
  service role is used only for slip PNG downloads and the chain RPC. Stored
  with doc_type `other` (the enum has no report type — extend it if reports
  multiply). Scope: events from the contact plus its deals/viewings/offers/
  leads; a property filter narrows to that property's entities and drops
  contact-level rows. Preview skips slip-image downloads; the PDF embeds them.
  `getMandateDocumentUrl` generalized into `lib/actions/documents.ts`
  (`getDocumentDownloadUrl`) — one RLS-checked signed-URL path for all
  private documents.

- **2026-07-13 · T5.1** — Calculators. Pure band math in
  `lib/services/calculators.ts` with tolerant config parsers — malformed
  `cyprus_config` renders an explicit error card, never NaN results. C8's
  "embedded on property/deal" is delivered as prefilled `/calculators?price=`
  links from the deal header (expected value) and property header (asking
  price) rather than duplicating calculator UI on three pages. Copy-summary
  uses the async Clipboard API with an execCommand fallback for contexts
  without transient activation. Summary strings are EN-only for Phase 1
  (i18n-ready: single composition point, moves to messages when EL/RU ship).

- **2026-07-13 · T4.6** — Keys. The movement row is the RLS-checked user
  action (append-only; new RLS test 13 proves UPDATE/DELETE stick for every
  role); the key row's status/current-holder is a derived cache updated with
  the service role AFTER the movement insert succeeds — the matrix allows
  agents to move keys but reserves register-row edits for admin/LM, so the
  cache write can't ride the user's client. Checkout requires `in_office`,
  return requires `checked_out`; `with_owner`/`lost` and the
  `transfer`/`mark_lost` actions exist in the enums but get UI in a later
  phase (BACKLOG). Holder can be a staff profile or a free-text external name
  (lawyer, cleaner) — spec's checkout dialog implies non-staff holders.

- **2026-07-13 · T4.5** — Mandates. `expire_mandates()` (migration 0006, doc 03
  synced) now also creates renewal tasks: one per active mandate inside its
  reminder window, assigned to `properties.assigned_agent_id` (fallback: the
  mandate's creator), idempotent via new `tasks.mandate_id`. Both the task
  creation and the expiry flip write system events (actor null). All UI mandate
  reads go through `mandates_safe` — including the property-header badge and
  the live quality-score inputs — so LM sees rows with commission masked and
  the badge still renders correctly for every role. Mandate CRUD is admin-only
  (mirrors RLS); `expired` is cron-only, admin transitions are draft→active
  and draft/active→terminated. Signed agreements upload to the private
  `documents` bucket + a `documents` row (`mandate_agreement`) linked via
  `signed_document_id`; downloads mint a 120s signed URL after an RLS-checked
  row read. Score staleness: the cron flip does NOT recompute quality/health
  (recomputes are TS-side, in-action) — scores refresh on the next mutation,
  same precedent as T3.3.

- **2026-07-13 · T4.4** — Route builder is a fourth view mode on `/viewings`
  (doc 05 puts the day route builder on that screen). Saving stamps
  `route_date` + 1-based `route_order` on each viewing and writes ONE summary
  `route_updated` event ({route_date, stops}) instead of N per-viewing events
  — reordering is one user action, and per-stop events would spam the log.
  Agents see only their own scheduled viewings in the builder (matching the
  RLS update policy so a save can't half-fail); admin routes across agents.
  The printable sheet lives at `/route-sheet` in a chromeless `(print)` route
  group (auth still enforced by proxy.ts), excludes cancelled viewings, and
  orders by the saved route_order. `initialRouteOrder` (unit-tested) seeds the
  builder: saved order for that day first, then unrouted stops by start time;
  a route saved for a different date is treated as stale and ignored.

- **2026-07-12 · T4.3** — Viewing feedback is written as a **property-scoped**
  event (`entity_type='property'`, `event_type='viewing_feedback'`, payload
  carries `viewing_id` + rating/notes) so it surfaces directly on the property
  activity timeline (C7 acceptance) without the timeline query needing to join
  viewings. Status changes (complete/cancel/no-show) stay viewing-scoped
  `status_changed {from,to}`, reusing the existing registry line. Feedback is
  gated to `completed` viewings; the agent-dashboard nudge lists the current
  user's completed viewings with `feedback is null`. Calendar cards now link to
  the new `/viewings/[id]` detail (property/sign/status/feedback all live
  there), so the per-card property and sign links were removed to declutter.

- **2026-07-12 · T4.2** — Slip signing. Added `@react-pdf/renderer` (the
  stack's sanctioned PDF lib, also needed for the C6 evidence report) and
  render the slip PDF server-side inside the sign action. The signature pad is
  dependency-free — a plain canvas with pointer events on a white background
  (white so the PNG has no alpha, keeping the PDF embed and SHA-256 stable).
  Both the PNG and PDF live in the private `signatures` bucket, uploaded with
  the service role (bucket has no RLS policies by design, doc 04); downloads go
  through `getSlipDownloadUrl`, which RLS-checks the slip row then mints a
  120s signed URL. One slip per viewing is enforced three ways: UI (already-
  signed state), an existence check in the action, and the `viewing_id` unique
  constraint. Verified end-to-end: the PNG re-downloaded from storage hashes to
  the stored `signature_sha256`.

- **2026-07-12 · T4.1** — Viewing times convert through an explicit Cyprus
  wall-clock ↔ UTC helper (`lib/utils/tz.ts`), never the browser's local zone:
  `zonedWallClockToUtc` reads a datetime-local value as Asia/Nicosia and stores
  UTC; `zonedParts` pre-computes each viewing's Cyprus day-bucket + minutes on
  the server so the calendar client does no tz math. All conversions pass the
  zone to Intl, so a UTC CI box and a Cyprus laptop agree (unit-tested across
  the DST boundary). Double-booking is advisory, not enforced: the create
  action never blocks, the dialog shows a live clash warning, and the calendar
  flags overlapping same-agent viewings. `EntityPicker` gained an optional
  `onChange` so the dialog can react to the agent selection.

- **2026-07-12 · T3.5** — Removed `app/(app)/properties/loading.tsx`. Its
  Suspense boundary triggers a Next 16.2.10 bug (dev-verified): the segment's
  suspense reveal stays queued (`<!--$~-->` markers) and NOTHING below
  `/properties` ever hydrates — tabs, forms, and media DnD were silently dead
  while SSR HTML looked fine. Isolated by bisection: minimal static page on the
  route still failed; removing loading.tsx fixed it; error.tsx is innocent and
  stays. Restore the skeleton when Next ships a fix (BACKLOG).

- **2026-07-11 · T3.3** — Health recompute writes NO event: the score is
  derived state and every trigger (deal save, offer change, KYC save, legal
  save, conversation log) already writes its own event — same precedent as
  the property quality score (§A8). The score + factor snapshot live on the
  deal (`health_score`, `health.factors`) so kanban cards render breakdown
  tooltips without per-card joins. Mandate CRUD doesn't exist yet (T4.5) —
  its recompute hook lands there; until then mandate changes surface at the
  next deal-side mutation.

- **2026-07-11 · T3.2** — UUID form fields validate with `z.guid()`, not Zod
  4's `z.uuid()`. Postgres' `uuid` type accepts any 32-hex-digit value, but
  Zod 4 `.uuid()` enforces RFC 4122 variant bits and rejected the seeded
  `11111111-…` admin id — the silent-drop `optionalUuid` helper then turned a
  round-tripped agent_id into `null` and deleted the assignment on save
  (caught in T3.2 browser verification via the event log's change diff).
  Fixed in deals + properties validators; audit of the remaining strict
  usages is in BACKLOG.
